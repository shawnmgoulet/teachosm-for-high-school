# Participation Guidelines

These guidelines cover our behavior as contributors making the TeachOSM for High School project possible.

## How to treat each other

* Be respectful and welcoming
* Try to understand different perspectives
* Do not threaten violence
* Empower others
* Strive for excellence
* Do not expect to agree with every decision

## Inclusion and Diversity

The TeachOSM for High School project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone.  The project welcomes contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community, including, but not limited to people of varied age, culture, ethnicity, gender, gender-identity, language, race, sexual orientation, geographical location and religious views.

The entire TeachOSM project is inclusive and supports diversity.

## Working in the Open

Because working open is at the backbone of the TeachOSM project, project planning is done in the open here on Github. We encourage you to take a look the CONTRIBUTING.md file to learn how we are working in the open.
