# **Preparation**

Teachers should acquaint themselves with [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org) (OSM) to begin gaining a basic understanding of OSM-related open mapping. 

1. Visit the OSM [website](https://openstreetmap.org)

    1. sign up for an OSM account 

    2. sign-in and choose the edit with iD editor

    3. Complete the iD editor walk through

1. Navigate to the  [OSM wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org)

    1. Search the wiki for keywords related to concepts, subjects and topics specific to your curriculum

        1. Examples: ‘language’, ‘government’, ‘military’, ‘food’ and agriculture’

    2. Generate a list of map features you/your students can find around school grounds

**Important:**

* OSM does not work with the Microsoft Internet Explorer web browser.  Use Mozilla Firefox, Chrome, Safari, or Opera.

* Although possible, tablets are NOT recommended for open mapping; most especially for newbies.  Either use a mouse with a desktop or laptop computer with a tracking pad.

# **Introduction**

This is the Overview Module intended to give teachers a summary overview of the individual modules included in the TeachOSM for High School initiative.  The modules are primarily intended to help AP Human Geography teachers connect open mapping to the AP Human Geography curriculum.  The modules are freely adaptable by teachers in other subject matter domains as well (e.g. U.S. History, Environmental Science, etc.).

This TeachOSM for High School initiative provides educators with scale-able OSM-centered geography-based educational modules developed to integrate with the [United States AP Human Geography curriculum](https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-human-geography), exposing students to 21st century mapping technology. The modules have been developed under the [TeachOSM](http://teachosm.org/) project umbrella.

* *Everyone* is invited to collaborate and contribute to the continued development ofthis meaningful organization of secondary education-level materials.

* All materials and knowledge available within this project is shared widely and freely.

A number of members of the TeachOSM community have been working with high school educators, most specifically AP Human Geography instructors, and students in the United States leveraging the OSM software to familiarize students with web maps, geospatial data / map features and projects connected to course sections. This kind of work has been [documented](http://teachosm.org/en/cases/cape-cod/) thus far.

This project was also part  of [Mozilla's Open Leadership Training](https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/projects/#teachosm-for-high-school) Round 3 cohort. The Open Leadership Training is a 14 week online mentorship program on working open in the Mozilla Network. The project was one of 39 selected from a pool of over 100 applications for the cohort.

To date, open mapping materials suitable for the AP Human Geography curriculum have not been organized and provided in a centralized, readily available, on-demand implementable state to educators.  Additionally, training for teachers integrating this flavor of education has not been available to educators.  This project aims to remedy these.

TeachOSM for High School will equip high school educators with a series of modules with scalable content, providing seamless incorporation into their existing geography curriculum, sensitive of the AP Human Geography schedule. This reduces the instructor workload and increases student contributions in open mapping.

In turn, this gives students the opportunity for hands-on exposure with 21st century geospatial mapping software and database structure, ultimately contributing to a global project having significant positive social impacts.

The design of the modules allow teachers to teach the basics of the OSM project, what the map is comprised of, how to efficiently and appropriately edit the map, tools to edit the map and how it ties into their curriculum.

Modules 1 through 4 feature an introduction to the OSM toolkit: [FieldPapers](http://fieldpapers.org/) for field data collection, a brief history on the rise of OSM, managing OSM accounts and the OSM interface, and basic editing techniques in OSM.

Modules 5 - 10 are more specific in nature, and serve to connect open mapping to the AP Human Geography curriculum.
