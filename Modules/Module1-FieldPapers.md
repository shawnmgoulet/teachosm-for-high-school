# Preparation

What should the facilitator do **before **teaching this lesson?

This module will guide teachers in *easily* using [Field Papers](http://fieldpapers.org/) to create aerial photograph base map(s) which the teacher will take students to map features in the field. 

1. Start on Page 4 of the LearnOSM – Surveying Field Papers Tutorial (Create and Print): [http://learnosm.org/files/Field_Papers_en.pdf](http://learnosm.org/files/Field_Papers_en.pdf)

2. Follow the steps 

3. You can choose Aerial Photography or Black and White Map

4. Some issues to think about:

1. Will the Map be Portrait or Landscape (May depend on the area of your school)

2. Adding a UTM grid

1. This may be useful if you want to break the students into groups.  You could give each student or a group of students one particular grid.

# Introduction

**Student Reading:** Students should read [learnOSM | Introduction](http://learnosm.org/en/beginner/introduction/) before the class with suggested questions formulated around the reading.

1. The reading discusses the important questions – ask your students why can a map answer these questions?  Map Scale

2. Ask the students what different features are on school grounds

3. What is the reasoning for the gird system?

# Activity

**Steps**

Step 1: Pass out the printed maps with colored pencils.  Assign a student or group of students to map a particular area on school grounds

Step 2: Using colored pencils students will add any features that are missing from the map.  These features should be "nailed down" features (i.e. buildings, trees, ballfields, not cars, etc.)

Step 3: Students then return to the classroom and present their results

Step 4: They will then be questioned by fellow students and possibly the teacher can question them:

1. Are all the features on the map?

2. Which ones are missing? What was their reasoning for adding and not adding certain features?  (For example, do the baseball players know the ballfields better than others?)

3. How familiar were the students with this part of the school grounds?

4. Did they think certain features were more important than others?

5. Did the students know the north part of campus, etc.?
