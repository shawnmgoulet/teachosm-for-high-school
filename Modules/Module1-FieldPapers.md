## **Preparation**

This module will guide teachers in **_easily_** using [Field Papers](http://fieldpapers.org/) to create aerial photograph base map(s) which the teacher will take students to identify and map [OSM map features](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features) in the field.

1. Begin on page 4 of the [LearnOSM | Surveying Field Papers Tutorial](http://learnosm.org/en/mobile-mapping/field-papers/) (create and print): [http://learnosm.org/files/Field_Papers_en.pdf](http://learnosm.org/files/Field_Papers_en.pdf)

2. Follow the steps outlined at the link

3. Choose the base map type.  Usually black and white works best to challenge students to locate themselves using scale and position.  Aerial photography is also an option if you feel students may need more assistance.

4. Additional issues to consider include:

    1. Will the map be portrait or landscape?  This depends on the area coverage of the property students will be mapping.

    2. Adding a grid of which squares can then be assigned to individual students or groups of students

## **Student Assignment**

Students should read [learnOSM | Introduction](http://learnosm.org/en/beginner/introduction/) before the class with suggested questions formulated around the reading.

1. The reading discusses the important questions – ask your students why can a map answer these questions?

2. Ask the students what different map features are on the property.

3. What is the reasoning for the grid system?

## **Student Exercise**

1. Pass out the printed maps with colored pencils.  Assign a student or group of students to map a particular area on school grounds

2. Using colored pencils students will add any features that are missing from the map.
**NOTE:**  These features should be "nailed down" features (i.e. buildings, trees, ballfields, not cars, etc.)

3. Students present their results

4. There will then be a class discussion centered around these questions:

    1. Are all the features on the map?

    2. Which ones are missing?  What was students’ reasoning for adding and not adding certain features?  For example, do the baseball players know the ballfields better than others?

    3. How familiar were the students with this part of the school grounds?

    4. Did students think certain features were more important than others?

    5. Did the students know the north part of campus, etc.?

5. If there are new features to add to OSM, teachers and students should add those once going through Module 3 | OSM Contribution Onboarding.
