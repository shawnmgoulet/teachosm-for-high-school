## **Introduction**

A mapathon is an event dedicated to open mapping.  Most open mapathons are informal events, with much collaboration taking place between mappers, making them ideal projects for flipped classrooms or project-based learning experiences.  This module takes the teacher through the steps needed to organize a mapathon in the classroom.  There are typically three steps to organizing a classroom mapathon: 1) Planning, 2) Preparation, and 3) Execution.

## **Offline & Online Activities**

While the actual mapathon event is dependent on internet connectivity, much of the actual planning and preparation can be done offline, particularly the Planning and Preparation stages.

# I. Planning the Mapathon

*Have a good idea about what you are mapping and why you are mapping it.*  Prior to organizing an event, you will want to have your mapping objectives firmly in mind.  For example, mapping farm-to-market roads in Guatemala to learn about agricultural issues, or mapping residential areas in different locations to estimate population density.  Mapping areas where current events and issues of concern are happening are often teachable and needed.

Toolset: Pen & Paper, or your favorite note-taking app

Time Required: ~1 hour

The two major considerations in planning a mapathon - theme and logistics:

1. Theme, or subject of the mapathon -

* What part of the world will you map? Your town? Foreign lands?

* What features will you be mapping? Buildings? Roads?

* Are you mapping to meet an APHG learning objective?

    * What is the purpose of the mapathon? What do you want to map and why?

    * Are you mapping to coincide with the Geography curriculum?

    * Are you mapping for humanitarian purposes?

    * Are you simply mapping to give more visibility to your community?

* Your mapathon need not connect with the APHG curriculum but you need to give students a compelling reason for what your mapping and the area of interest. You might offer students a choice of mapping activities, such as hometown landmarks, humanitarian mapping or street surveys and then let the students drive the activity.



2. Mapathon logistics - refers to the actual mechanics of executing the mapathon.

* Consider Mapathon Logistics

    * Are you planning to host your mapathon in your school’s computer lab? Or, perhaps in the school library?

    * During or outside of school hours?

    * Will students BYOD (bring their own devices)?

    * How is your Internet connection quality?

    * Is the internet browser (Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, etc.) software up-to-date?

### Planning Event Logistics

What space will you use for your event?

    * Classroom or computer lab?

    * Have you checked with your school’s IT department to insure Operating System (OS) is updated/patched?

    * Are students using their own machines?

    * Compatible browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Safari) install and up-to-date? (*Note: MS Internet Explorer will NOT work with OpenStreetMap*)

# II. Preparation for the Mapathon

During the Preparation phase, teachers create the tasks, write mapping instructions, and introduce new mappers to the OpenStreetMap interface.

Review the instructions for the OpenStreetMap Tasking Manager. In the mapathon preparation stage, you will need to create your task on the OpenStreetMap Tasking Manager ([http://tasks.teachosm.org](http://tasks.teachosm.org)). Review the instructions prior to project creation. Insure also, that you have Project Manager privileges (NOTE:  To obtain Project Manager privileges for the TeachOSM Tasking Manager, please send an email request to: info@teachosm.org) to create a new task. The Tasking Manager technical reference can be found at [http://learnosm.org/en/coordination/tasking-manager/](http://learnosm.org/en/coordination/tasking-manager/).

### Creating Projects on the TeachOSM Tasking Manager

* Tool Set: The Tasking Manager

    * Use either the TeachOSM or HOT Tasking Manager

            * [http://tasks.teachosm.org](http://tasks.teachosm.org) - Create your first project here

            * [http://tasks.hotosm.org](http://tasks.hotosm.org) - Find ready-made humanitarian projects here

    * Time Required: 20 minutes per task

    * Point to one of the Tasking Managers (HOT or TeachOSM)

    * Use the search options to select a task meaningful to you: humanitarian, local, area of concern, etc.

    * Draft instructions for your task. Give the students explicit instruction on what to digitize: buildings, roads, points-of-interest, or whatever it may be.

    * Enter a default changeset comment for this task. It may be something like, "Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, #HarloweHighSchool, 2017, source=Digital Globe Premium". Be descriptive so we can filter by changeset comment later on.

* OR, Choose an existing job from the HOT or TeachOSM Tasking Managers ([http://tasks.hotosm.org](http://tasks.hotosm.org) or [http://tasks.teachosm.org](http://tasks.teachosm.org))

### Create Tabletop Instructions for Event Day

The tabletop template can be downloaded from the TeachOSM website. This MS Word template allows you to create custom instructions for your event. Edit, print, fold, and tape, then place on each table (or in a common place) during the mapathon.

[Upload to TeachOSM Github repo]

### Introduce Students to OpenStreetMap

If this is the first time your students have seen OpenStreetMap, take time to do the following:

    * Give mappers an overview of OpenStreetMap, demonstrate your editing prowess ;-)

    * Have mappers select usernames and passwords, then create OSM accounts

        * Teachers: record your students’ usernames for later assessment

        * Students: will need access to their email to verify OSM accounts

    * Introduce them to the OpenStreetMap interface and have them take the walkthrough to the iD editor

    * Give them free time to explore

        * Show the controls for native OSM

        * Show the controls for the iD editor

# III. Mapathon Event Day

Toolset(s): Tabletop Instructions, ShowMeTheWay, iD Editor, OSM Tasking Manager

Time Required: 1 hour (or more)

### Teacher Activities:

### Distribute Tabletop instructions to Tables

Place the pre-printed instructions on the tables before the students begin mapping.

### Display real-time edits to OpenStreetMap with Show Me the Way

If you have a monitor in your classroom or lab, you can view edits to OpenStreetMap in (near!) real-time. Connect the monitor to your computer’s external display port. Then, point your browser to **[OSM Show Me the Way](https://osmlab.github.io/show-me-the-way/)** or **[ OSM Live Edits](http://live.openstreetmap.fr/)**. It may take a minute or two to get started.

### Conduct basic mapping training

As part of **[Module 4](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nGCY-8AocfgK3kzPlme9nOshn0x2rtzv8mQz41ENKX0)**, you may have given your students basic training in OpenStreetMap editing techniques. If not, now is the time to train on basic OpenStreetMap editing techniques. Make sure to cover:

* Basic Editing & Tagging Instruction

    * How to digitize a building

    * How to edit roads

    * Adding local business & institutions to the map

### Instruct students to access the mapping tasks on the Tasking Manager

Student activity:

* Point the browser to [http://tasks.teachosm.org](http://tasks.teachosm.org)

* Log into OpenStreetMap, if not logged in

* Search for the task by number or name

* Read the instructions and review the rules for marking a square complete

* Have students select a square and begin editing!

### Use Overpass Turbo during & after the event:

Overpass Turbo is a  web based data mining tool for OpenStreetMap. Teachers will use it to monitor the mapping progress of students. Students should learn to use it as well, in order to monitor themselves.

Toolset: Overpass Turbo

Time Required: ~15 minutes

Point your browser to [http://overpass-turbo.eu](http://overpass-turbo.eu/) With overpass turbo you can run Overpass API queries and analyze the resulting OpenStreetMap data interactively on a map.

1. Navigate to the area your are working

2. Click the Wizard button

3. Use the following syntax to search for your OSM edits:user: your_osm_name eg. user:RAHinton

4. Your stats show up in the bottom right corner of screen

* * *


## Metrics

Gather results from the mapathon, both collectively and individually.

If you assigned a quota, use Overpass-Turbo to select by username and then use the tally in the bottom righthand corner for results.

Ask the students to answer the following questions in their journals:

* How did this mapathon connect you with issues on the ground? Was it helpful in connecting with issues in other lessons (e.g. population, urban development, agriculture?)

* Was is difficult to determine what was on the ground? There is a skill associated with aerial imagery interpretation. Tracing guides are available for some regions of the world here: [https://hotosm.github.io/tracing-guides/](https://hotosm.github.io/tracing-guides/)

* Were students able to make use of the different features in the iD editor (e.g. imagery options, filters, square buildings, changeset comments)? How does it contribute to their understanding of data quality? Data accuracy?

## Games and competitions:

Introduce some friendly competition at mapathons with OSM Fight: [http://osmfight.neis-one.org/](http://osmfight.neis-one.org/)
