**Student Assignment**

1. Students can be put into groups and given one cultural component?  Religion, Sports Facilities, Restaurants. 

2. Students should then begin to mentally map on a piece of paper the location of their cultural facilities.

3. Then each group can present their findings 

4. Then have the students use Overpass Turbo to examine their findings: [http:/](http://overpass-turbo.eu/)[/overpass-turbo.eu/](http://overpass-turbo.eu/) Run Overpass API queries and analyze the resulting OpenStreetMap data interactively on a map.

    1. Navigate to the area your are working. Use the search box or just pan manually.

    2. Click the Wizard button

    3. Use the following syntax to search for your OSM edits:user: your_osm_name eg. user:SEJohnson

    4. Your stats show up in the bottom right corner of screen

5. Which buildings and institutions are missing?

6. Students then can go into OpenStreetMap and add the missing buildings or institutions.

7. Students should use the OpenStreetMap Wiki to understand the tagging system.  Here is the Religion Category: [http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:religion](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:religion)
