# TeachOSM for High School

This TeachOSM for High School project under the [TeachOSM](http://teachosm.org) project umbrella provides educators with modular, scale-able [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) - related geography-based educational exercises developed to integrate with the [United States AP Human Geography curreiculum](https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-human-geography/course-details).

* **_Everyone_ is invited to collaborate to produce this meaningful organization of secondary education-level materials.**
* **All materials and knowledge available within this project is shared widely and freely.**

## Background

A number of collaborators within the TeachOSM community have been working with high school educators and students in the United States over the past four years leveraging the [OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) software to familiarize students with web maps, geospatial data and map features and projects connected to course sections.  This kind of work has been [documented](http://teachosm.org/en/cases/cape-cod/) thus far.

This project was selected as one of [Mozilla's Open Leadership Training](https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/projects/#teachosm-for-high-school) Round 3 projects.  The Open Leadership Training is a 14 week online mentorship program on working open in the Mozilla Network.  The project is one of 39 selected from a pool of over 100 applications.

## Project Purpose/Summary

Thus far, TeachOSM for High School materials have not been organized and provided in a readily available, central and in an on-demand implementable state to educators.  This project will achieve just that.

Upon it's completion, the project will equip secondary school educators with a scale-able TeachOSM for High School curriculum, providing seamless incorporation into their existing geography curriculum without negatively impacting instructor workload and student education.

In turn, this project will ultimately provide students the opportunity for hands-on exposure with 21st century geospatial mapping software and database structure, ultimately contributing to a global project having significant positive social impacts.  Lastly, the belief is that with an increase in exposure to and contributions from a streamline of generations will result in a rise in sustained contributions and innovation within and around the OSM project.

Once completed, these resources will be made available on the [TeachOSM site](http://teachosm.org), free of charge.
Modules will be constructed being mindful of United States AP Human Geography course components, content and schedule.
