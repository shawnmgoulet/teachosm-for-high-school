# TeachOSM for High School

This TeachOSM for High School project under the [TeachOSM](http://teachosm.org) project umbrella provides educators with modular, scale-able [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) (OSM) - related geography-based educational modules developed to integrate with the [United States AP Human Geography curriculum](https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-human-geography).

* **_Everyone_ is invited to collaborate to produce this meaningful organization of secondary education-level materials.**
* **All materials and knowledge available within this project is shared widely and freely.**

## Background

A number of members of the TeachOSM community have been working with high school educators, most specifically AP Human Geography instructors, and students in the United States over the past four years leveraging the [OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) software to familiarize students with web maps, geospatial data / map features and projects connected to course sections.  This kind of work has been [documented](http://teachosm.org/en/cases/cape-cod/) thus far.

This project is also one of [Mozilla's Open Leadership Training](https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/projects/#teachosm-for-high-school) Round 3 cohort projects.  The Open Leadership Training is a 14 week online mentorship program on working open in the Mozilla Network.  The project is one of 39 selected from a pool of over 100 applications for this cohort.

## Project Purpose/Summary

Thus far, TeachOSM for High School materials have not been organized and provided in a readily available, central and in an on-demand implementable state to educators.  This project will achieve just that.

Upon it's completion, TeachOSM for High School will equip high school educators with a module-arranged, scale-able content, providing seamless incorporation into their existing geography curriculum, sensitive of the AP Human Geography schedule. This will not negatively impact instructor workload and student education.

In turn, this project will ultimately provide students the opportunity for hands-on exposure with 21st century geospatial mapping software and database structure, ultimately contributing to a global project having significant positive social impacts.

The design of the modules allow teachers to teach the basics of the OSM project, what the map is comprised of, how to efficiently and appropriately edit the map, tools to edit the map and how it ties into their curriculum.

## OSM Contribution

Once completed, these resources will be made available on the TeachOSM site, free of charge in a web-based fashion for anyone and will be continually updated by contributors.

Long-term, it is the hope that an increase in exposure to and contributions from a younger demographic will result in many benefits including a rise in sustained OSM contributors, greater accuracy of contributions and innovation within and around the OSM project.
