# TeachOSM for High School

This is the repository for TeachOSM for High School, a project within the [TeachOSM project website](http://teachosm.org).

Here you will find a set of community contributed resources for secondary educators who wish to bring OpenStreetMap into their classrooms. These resources are for you to use, free of charge.
Modules will be constructed being mindful of United States AP Human Geography course components and schedule. It is the intent of this project to provide easily implementable modules tailored to content and mindful of schedule.
